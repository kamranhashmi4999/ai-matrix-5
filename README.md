# AI Matrix Solutions: The Anti-Chatbot

## Overview

AI Matrix Solutions bridges the gap between current AI capabilities and real-world business needs. While AI technology has advanced significantly, its practical application in business often falls short. Common AI implementations like chatbots, despite their appeal, fail to meet the complex demands of business operations. AI Matrix Engine and AI Matrix collectively strive to make sophisticated AI both accessible and practical for business use, overcoming the limitations of traditional AI applications.

### AI Matrix Engine

- A core AI automation framework developed in Python.
- Enables rapid development and deployment of complex AI systems.
- Caters to businesses needing advanced AI integration without the constraints of traditional methods.

### AI Matrix

- A user-friendly, no-code platform built using React, Next.js, and TypeScript.
- Allows businesses to effortlessly build AI applications, making advanced AI tools accessible without extensive technical knowledge.
- Currently under development, AI Matrix is the first of many no-code, user-friendly interfaces that will be built on top of the AI Matrix Engine.

## Development Guidelines

**Daily Workflow:**

- **Morning:**
  - At the start of each development day, pull the latest version of the 'main' branch.
  - Merge it fully with your branch to ensure you have the latest changes.
  - Resolve all conflicts and push the updated code to your branch.

- **Evening:**
  - At the end of your development day, repeat the morning steps: pull the latest 'main', merge, and resolve all conflicts within your code.
  - Push the updated code to your branch.
  - If there are issues that need to be resolved on 'main', report them to the lead developer, **Armani Sadeghi**.
