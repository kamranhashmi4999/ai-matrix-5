# Template for Each of OUR Internal APPS
## Don't confuse this with the "apps" that people build with our system
Our apps are Intelligence, AI APPS, PRODUCTIVITY, TOOLS, INTEGRATIONS, MATRIX ENGINE, ETC.
- Within each app, we have many modules and the handling of these needs to be templated in many ways.

# Core Concepts:
- Templated apps
- REUSE, REUSE and REUSE!
- For each component or group of components, we need to create reusable parts that can be used in other apps.
- Each app will be different in many ways, but the look and feel needs to be the same everywhere
- The purpose of this template is to show the basic structure we want


- But I ran out of time to customize it today!
