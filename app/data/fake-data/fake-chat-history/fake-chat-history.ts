Can you create the UI and the TypeScript files I would need to show this in a table and then allow them to click on one and have the values show in some input fields that are disabled at first, but if they click the edit button, they become enabled and they can make changes and save? When they save, I want it to update the JSON file please. I also want to add a \"notes\" field to this that will be blank for now, but they can add their own notes." },
