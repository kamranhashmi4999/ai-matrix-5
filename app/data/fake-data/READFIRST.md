# Read before using Fake Data!

I purposely called this fake-data and even considered calling it fake-data-do-not-use for the directory.

The reason is that I HATE fake data in the application, especially when developers start lying to themselves
and thinking that the fake data they are using is like real data. It's not!

Getting data from the database or an api is one of the most important jobs for a developer. Anyone can create ui, 
but you have to be able to get data, manipulate it, restructure it and put it in and out of components.

So, if you are going to have any fake data, including values in a drop down menu or anything else, I would prefer that
you avoid it as much as possible, but when you really need it, ON A TEMPORARY basis, you can use fake data.

But even with fake data, make sure you get rid of it quickly or do what you can to have it mimic real data.

I will try to create some examples for how to make fake data mimic real data when I can.
